## Version 2.0.0.0 â€“ December 18th, 2016
Comparation with bootstrap 3 theme:
- Rewritten {BOOTSTRAP_USERNAV}  - used a lot of variables to understand how it should work, before taken for granted
- Rewritten navigation_template.php (main, footer)
- Removed glyphicon support (not supported in Bootstrap 4)

Standard theme developing:
- Implemented header + footer css and scripts
- Changed combination {NAVIGATION} + {BOOTSTRAP_USERNAV} - usernav links are part of navbar, not separate navigation (there was always problem with styling)
- Implemented Book/Chapter system for Portfolio/Projects - only porfolio template is needed to set for book
- Implemented Modal portfolio (displayed pages)
- Theme shortcode XURL_ICONS
- Standard site disclaimer
- Theme preferencies CDN/localhost
